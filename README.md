## Project Translation

Please DON'T edit directly the language files in github repository but instead edit the language files in Transiflex repository.

To improve the crowdsourcing experience for non-developers, thia project is translated on Transiflex at this web page

https://www.transifex.com/qwertycube/apk-editor-studio/

Please use the following instructions:

When the translation will be ready, I manually will add the .ts files to the repo and update the referencing projects files, installer configurations, etc.

## Compilation

### Requirements

- Qt 5
- C++11 compiler

### Setting Up

**APK Editor Studio** depends on multiple third-party binary tools which are not included in this repository.
In order to successfully utilize this software, the following tools should be present on your system:

- `apktool` to (un)pack APK
- `apksigner` to sign APK
- `zipalign` to optimize APK
- `adb` to install APK and manage Android devices

You can either get them manually (e.g., using `apt-get` in Debian)
or **run the `scripts/download.py`** Python 3 script which will automatically download the needed tools.

Also, on **Linux** you may want an optional support for `libsecret` password storage backend.
In order to enable it, you will need to install the corresponding library:
- `libsecret-1-dev` (Debian-based distributions)
- `libsecret-devel` (RPM-based distributions)

### Building

- `qmake`
- `make`

Note that the build tools may vary on different platforms (e.g., `make`/`nmake`/`jom`).
You can also use Qt Creator IDE to compile APK Editor Studio
without manually specifying the paths and running the build tools.

Optionally, run `make install` to install APK Editor Studio to `/usr`.  
Pass the `PREFIX` variable to `qmake` in order to define a different installation directory.

### Packaging

If you want to create installation/executable APK Editor Studio packages,
the corresponding scripts are located at `scripts/**/packages` (where `**` is a platform name).
Every platform directory contains an `environment` script file which sets the paths to the
required tools. Feel free to edit these variables to correspond the paths on your system.
